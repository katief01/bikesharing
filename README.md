# Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this analysis was to perform a bike trip analysis to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. In this analysis we showed the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each weekday, and the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each weekday.

# Summary: 
Our analysis showed that almost 150,000 bike rides took place during the month of August in New York City.  These rides were mostly male riders and more often took place before work hours (6-9am) and after work hours (5-8pm) during the week.  The majority of riders were subscribers which will give investors an idea of what type of user to expect in Des Moines. The top starting locations in our analysis are not completely relevant since Manhattan is a high tourist area, but does suggest that bike rentals will be highest in city areas.  Additional visualizations to show the difference in revenue throughout the year and revenue percentages based on users would help investors to predict revenue trends in the city of Des Moines.
